OOPs CONCEPT
OOPs-Object-Oriented Programming is programming paradigm that uses objects and classes. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation etc in programming language. The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.

Main Concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) 
•	Class
•	Objects
•	Polymorphism
•	Encapsulation
•	Inheritance
•	Data Abstraction
CLASS:
	A Class is collection of objects. A class can contains the blueprint. It is logical entity that contains attributes and methods. Class are created by using class Keyword.
SYNTAX:
	Class Name:
		Statement1
		…….
		…….
		……
		Statement n
In python, the class Attributes are always public can be accessed using dot(.) Operator.
OBJECTS:
	An object is simply a collection of data (Variables) and methods(functions) that act on those data. 

INIT METHOD
	All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.
Use the __init() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created:
The __init__() function is called automatically every time the class is being used to create a new object.
